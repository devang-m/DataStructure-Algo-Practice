/*
When Maverick gets his cards, he has to arrange them in groups so that all the cards in a group are of the same color. 
Next, he has to sort the cards in each group by their value â€“ card with lowest value should be the leftmost in its group.

He has to arrange his cards as quickly as possible, i.e. making as few moves as possible. A move consists of changing a position of one of his cards.

The idea is mainly to generate all permutations of the card colours. 
For 3 colours, there will be 3! permutations
1,2,3
1,3,2
2,1,3
2,3,1
3,1,2
3,2,1
Then using each of these permuations calculate the current permuation value of the holding cards and find the LIS of the sequence.
The answer is the minimum value of (c*n - the LIS) of all the permutations
